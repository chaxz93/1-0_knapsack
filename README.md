Under the Bitcoin protocol, a block can contain up to 1000000 bytes of transactions.
Miners can freely choose transactions to include in a block, and once they mine a block, they
earn the transaction fees for each transaction in the block and an additional 12.5 BTC as a
reward (as of May 2017).

Please find the maximum possible reward for creating a block using the following 12
transactions:

Notes
A block cannot contain the same transaction more than once.
For simplicity, there are no dependencies between transactions, and any combination of
transactions can be included in a block.
Also for the sake of simplicity you may ignore the fact that blocks must always contain a
coinbase transaction.
